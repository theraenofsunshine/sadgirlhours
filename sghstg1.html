    <h1> comparing yourself</h1>
    <p id="step1">
        Usually I compare myself everyday. It is not a good thing to do, I know. Realistically, everyone has compared 
        themselves to other people at one point or another. It does nothing but harm me.  I compare myself, especially 
        when I am on social media, to others to this day. I keep reminding myself "You can not compare your breathing real life to someone's online
        persona that they have created". Everyone is on their own journey and is at a different point in their life.
        But I know I am going to continue until I learn to better love myself and what I already have because of social media and its power
        on my psyche and perception of what I think my life shoud look like. I am still learning; everyone is still learning.
