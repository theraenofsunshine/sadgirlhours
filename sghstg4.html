<div width="50"> 
    <p id="step4"> After going through vices and crying, if they do not satisfy me I breakdown. Breaking down
        is different for everyone and there are different types of breaking down. Usually for me when I am breaking down, I stop contacting people,
        lose motivation quickly, get angry quickly, and become cold towards everyone and everything. Sometimes it comes to the 
        point where I am in a crippling state. I stay in bed and do not get up for anything or anyone. There are so many other signs and sometimes someone is having a breakdown and you
        do not know it. Breakdowns are difficult and it is a part of life. Everyone has a breakdown atleast once in their lifetime. It happens more than you know. 
        There are two options that you can choose, going through it or letting go.
