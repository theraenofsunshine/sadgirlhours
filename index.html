    <p id="intro"> During this time of so much hate and isolation in the world, social media has become this
        negative platform that has caused so much anxiety and uncertainty. The isolation has caused me 
        to be more depressed and less motivated in school and life. I have battled depression and anxiety my 
        whole life, it is nothing new. But now it is a lot easier to become indulged in sad girl hours as i like to call it. 
        Everyone's experience with mental illness or their mental health is different and that is okay. This project highlights my 
        experience and what happens when I go through a breakdown and what leads up to it. Along with what I have gained from these experiences 
        and drawings that are inspired by my sad girl hours.</p>
