    <p id="step2"> After I have officialy broken down every part of myself that I do not like or I need to work on,
        I cry. I am an emotionally sensitive person and it is so easy for me to cry. The other day I cried over my coffee
        spilling on my desk. But when I do compare myself or begin thinking about everything that I have been through this year,
        I cry for hours. Not the clean kinda teary eyed crying, but the ugly crying where I have snot dripping out of my nose 
        and I have a migraine for a couple days after. It is okay to cry. Do not feel bad about crying, you are not a robot.
        I would be concerned about myself if I did not cry. Please give yourself a good cry session that makes you fall asleep after
        and then you wake up refreshed. It is your body recognizing there is something wrong with your mental well being, let 
        yourself recognize you are not okay. It is okay to not be okay.   </p>
