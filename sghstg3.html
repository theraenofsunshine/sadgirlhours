    <p id="step3"> After I have an ugly cry or a one minute cry session, I usually partake in some type of vice
        usually mine consists of energy drinks, working a lot, red line drawings, and cigarettes, I know I should stop doing
        that one. I am working on it. But other people can have healthy vices or unhealthy vices. For instance, a healthy vice could
        be spending time with supportive and loving friends, drinking some good tea, or watching your comfort show or movie. Those are examples of
        taking care of yourself. Please take care of yourself. Unfortuantely there are unhealthy vices like smoking, drinking alcohol,
        heavy workloads, self harm, and/or sexual intercourse frequently. These vices are so easy to think that they are helping you because it gives you a 
        second of pleasure. This is not taking care of yourself and they do not help, coming from someone who has done all of them.
        You can only work on yourself and define what you need, I am not here to judge you in any type of way. The way you work on
        yourself and mental well being is up to you and only you.   </p>
