    <p id="gti"> Going through a breakdown is hard and it is the best thing you can do at that point. It happens and it
    is okay to allow it to happen. The real hard part is after, getting yourself back. Getting yourself to be productive 
    and proactive. You can clean up the aftermath and take care of yourself. Stop yourself from going into a self destructive
    spiral. I clean my room, write down everything I want to accomplish in a week, and then I am kind to myself. I take care of
    myself by taking medication and watching my favorite tv shows and movies or I create red line drawings. I avoid participating
    in unhleathy vices and take part in healthy ways to get myself back to a calmer place. It is a lot easier too say all of this
    than do it. This is all a process. Be kind to yourself and lenient about not being productive or happy right away. Below I have left
    different resources I have gained from. </p>
